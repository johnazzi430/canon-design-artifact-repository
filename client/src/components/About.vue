    <h1>About</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>The existing process of digital development within UTC has created a
      wealth of digital products that are both internal and externally facing.
      These products in most cases are the results of individual teams within
      individuals business units, without collaboration from teams external
      to them. A result of this is inconsistent boundaries and overlapping
      requirements leading to a mess of user experiences from our employees
      and customers. We need a way to allow engineers, designers,
      product management and leaders to engage in collaborative
      design and understanding of our target users for our products.
